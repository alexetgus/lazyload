# Lazyload

Lazy loading for images displayed in SMF messages.


### Description:

This modification (for SMF 2.0 Final only) adds a feature allowing posts images to be loaded only when they are needed.
If an image is not in the display window, it is not loaded.
The display of a page thus becomes faster.

**_This feature is essential for mobile phones that are charged by the amount of data they consume._**
